 <p align="left"> Today's main issue is about racism. Racism has been within the people since the 17th century. Americans and other countries are buying black people to make them slaves. Because they think black people are different, they have that mindset that people who has colored skin is different like the Africans. And today black people are getting killed because of racism. Like George Floyd, who has been killed because the store clerk alleged that he had passed a counterfeit $20 and the police officer held down his knee to George's neck that's why he cannot breathe and eventually died because of heart failure and asphyxiation from sustained pressure. We can treat and love each other because we are all brothers and sisters.
